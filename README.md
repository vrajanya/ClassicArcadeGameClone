## Game Rules

* In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). 
* The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.
* The player can move left, right, up and down.
* The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
* Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
* Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won


## Technical

This project consists of the following assets:

* **index.html**  - contains the game's html structure.
* **style.css** - contains the game's board styling.
* **app.js** - contains most of the player & enemy actions & logic.


## Additional Functionality

* Player selection: allow the user to select the image for the player character before starting the game. You can use the different character images provided in the images folder (weâ€™ll get to that below)
* Score: you can implement a score for the game. For example, the score can increase each time the player reaches the water, and it can be reset to 0 when collision occurs (or it can be reduced)

## Credits

* **resources.js** - images are rendereded from a cache, provided by Udacity as part of the starter code.
